### 🧠 About Me

I'm a self-taught backend developer with 3+ years of experience building Django-based systems, and 20 years of experience as a Chemical Engineer in mining, operations, and consulting.

I specialise in test-driven Django development, DRF APIs, PostgreSQL databases, and integrations with OpenAI (ChatGPT) and Plotly Dash dashboards. I debug live systems with AWS CloudWatch and Log Insights, and build logic from YAML-powered workflows.
