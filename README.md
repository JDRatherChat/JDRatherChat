### ðŸ§  About Me

I'm a backend developer with 3+ years of hands-on Python/Django experience, and 20 years of prior work in the mining sector as a qualified Chemical Engineer.

I transitioned into coding full-time after years of automating reporting and analysis with Excel VBA. Now I work on production systems that integrate Django, DRF, PostgreSQL, AWS CloudWatch, and OpenAI (ChatGPT), built using test-driven development and YAML-driven logic flows.

Iâ€™m focused on building robust, clean, and maintainable backend systems â€” and always learning something new.
